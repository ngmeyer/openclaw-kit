- Bright white text on blue (poor contrast)
- Flat design with basic cards

### After (iOS App Theme - Dark Mode)
**Colors from AppTheme.swift:**

- Blue light: `#3B5CC9` (gradient accents)
- Coral accent: `#FB7C4A`

**Key Visual Changes:**
- ✅ Cover page: Dark background with subtle blue gradient radial overlay

## ✍️ WRITING STYLE TRANSFORMATION

### Before: Technical Documentation
- Third-person, formal tone
- Generic feature lists
- Corporate "we're excited to introduce" language
- Dry, academic style

### After: Personal Newsletter
- **First-person voice:** "I", "you", conversational
- **Personal anecdotes:** Real stories about frustrations with ChatGPT
- **Opinionated:** "Stop paying $20/month for someone else's AI"
- **Relatable:** "The moment you'll get it..." storytelling
- **Honest trade-offs:** Acknowledges setup complexity vs. hosted convenience
- **Emotional connection:** "See you on the other side. 🦞"

**Examples of Tone Shift:**
- Old: "OpenClaw is a personal AI agent platform"
- New: "Six months ago, I was paying $60/month for ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and Gemini Advanced. Then I discovered something that changed everything..."
