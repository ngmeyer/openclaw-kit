# OpenClawKit Deployment Guide

## Inspired by SimpleClaw: Simplified Deployment

### Deployment Philosophy
Our goal is to reduce OpenClaw deployment from 30+ minutes to under 1 minute:

**Traditional Method (30 min)**
- Purchase local virtual machine (10 min)
- Create SSH keys (3 min)
- Connect to server via SSH (3 min)
- Install Node.js and NPM (5 min)
- Install OpenClaw (2 min)
- Configure OpenClaw (5 min)
- Connect Telegram (2 min)

**OpenClawKit Method (<1 min)**
- Pick a model
- Connect Telegram
- Deploy
- DONE ✅

### Key Differentiators
- Pre-configured servers ready to assign
- Secure, fast channel connections
- Minimal technical complexity
- 24/7 active AI assistant deployment
